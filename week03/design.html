            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <p>The rule of thirds is a "rule of thumb" or guideline which applies to the process of composing visual images, such as designs, films, paintings, and photographs. The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections.</p>

            <h2>Fitts's Law</h2>
            <p>Fitts's Law (often cited as Fitts' Law) is a predictive model of human movement, primarily used in human–computer interaction and ergonomics. The law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.</p>

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <p>Hick's Law (or Hick–Hyman Law) is a law of psychophysics describing the time it takes for a person to make a decision based on the number of choices available. Increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically.</p>

            <h2>Gestalt Principles</h2>
            <p>The Gestalt principles (also Gestalt laws or Gestalt theory) are a set of principles, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists, describing the natural ways in which the human brain perceives whole objects and complex systems. These principles provide a framework for understanding how we perceive and organize visual information.</p>

            <h2>Zeigarnik Effect</h2>
            <p>The Zeigarnik Effect states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. This cognitive bias suggests that the mind remains active and focused on incomplete goals, leading to better recall.</p>

            <h2>Occam's Razor</h2>
            <p>Occam's Razor (also spelled Ockham's Razor and Latin: lex parsimoniae, the law of parsimony) is the problem-solving principle that, among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. The idea is attributed to William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347), a Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian.</p>

            <h2>Pareto Principle</h2>
            <p>The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Management consultant Joseph M. Juran applied the principle to quality control and improvement, and it was named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.</p>
